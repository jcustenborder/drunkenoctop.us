=============================

I put together a guide that I am refining as I get feedback from others
that documents the steps and considerations I took while converting the
stock Lulzbot TAZ6 with RAMBo 1.3L to the Archim2 controller board. With
more people using this configuration, the development curve should
accelerate! `Lulzbot TAZ6 Archim2 Conversion -
