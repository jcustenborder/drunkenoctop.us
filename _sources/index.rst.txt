*Drunken Octopus* Marlin: An Alternative (Unofficial) Firmware for LulzBot Printers
===================================================================================

Hello. My name is Marcio. I was the Firmware Engineer at LulzBot prior
to the massive `layoff of 2019 <https://www.fabbaloo.com/blog/2019/10/12/the-end-of-lulzbot>`__
that decimated the staff and left nearly one hundred people out of a
job.

At the time I was let go, I was a `major contributor <https://github.com/marcio-ao>`__ to the
upcoming version of Marlin, Marlin 2.0.

When Marlin 2.0 comes out, it will bring a host of new features and
benefits. But ensuring Marlin 2.0 remains compatible with LulzBot
printers requires someone to work with the Marlin developers so that
they know our needs. During my nearly three years at LulzBot, I
developed a close working relationship with several Marlin developers
and helped make sure LulzBot printers were always well supported.

I've set up *Drunken Octopus* Marlin to continue that work of making
sure users of LulzBot printers will not be left behind.

Who can benefit from *Drunken Octopus* Marlin?
----------------------------------------------

This firmware is for users who want the very latest firmware and
features for their LulzBot printers and **are willing to take the risks
associated with running development firmware**. It is also for people
who want to modify or upgrade their LulzBot printers.

LulzBot made a conservative decision of keeping most customers on older
but internally tested firmware. They turned off certain features for the
comfort of new users. On the contrary, *Drunken Octopus* will charge
right ahead, taking it all in, because that is how he likes to roll!
:sunglasses:

*Drunken Octopus* comes in up to 196 different flavors!
-------------------------------------------------------

If you are savvy with electrical and mechanical things, *Drunken
Octopus* will give you the software to match any hardware upgrades you
make to your printer. See the `FAQ </docs/FAQ.md>`__ for a complete list
of supported printers and upgrades!

How can you help make *Drunken Octopus* a success?
==================================================

To help me the most, please consider contributions via my
`Patreon page <https://www.patreon.com/marciot>`_

Working on Marlin used to be a paid, full-time job for me, but without
LulzBot to support me, I will have to work on my own time using my own
resources. In exchange for your help, I hope to create content, such as
printer upgrade guides and other tutorials. I learned a *ton* at the R&D
department at LulzBot and I have much I want to teach you!

Even if you are unable to contribute, I can still use your help. See the
`FAQ </docs/FAQ.md>`__ for a list of non-monetary ways to chip in!
