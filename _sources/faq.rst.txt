F.A.Q.
======

Will *Drunken Octopus* binaries and pre-build configuration files be provided?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get you started with *Drunken Octopus*, pre-built binaries and
configs will be provided for the **stock toolhead** for each **standard
LulzBot printer** (as indicated by :factory: in `this
page <Supported-Printers-and-Toolheads>`__). Check the `releases
page <https://github.com/marciot/drunken-octopus-marlin/releases>`__ on
GitHub.

`Patreon supporters <https://www.patreon.com/marciot>`__ will receive
firmware or configuration files for modified printers and accessory
toolheads (and possibly other variations, as time goes on!). These will
also be in the releases page, in the form of a password protected file,
sometime after the basic firmware is released. Patreon supporters will
be notified of the password once these releases are made.

Source code for building everything will always be available to anyone!

Will using *Drunken Octopus* void my printer warranty?
------------------------------------------------------

Probably, if you let LulzBot know about it.

Will *Drunken Octopus* damage my printer?
-----------------------------------------

He doesnâ€™t mean to, but it depends on how much he has had to drink the
night before! **Use Drunken Octopus at your own risk.**

What if I want my printer to remain sober?
------------------------------------------

Reach out to `LulzBot <https://www.lulzbot.com/>`__ and use their
firmware. Rumor has it they are still answering the phone.
